# Notes
- steal from SB w/ 3.5x blind
- call from SB/BB when BTN opens/or someone has big stack as you. 
  - if hit nuts, check/raise 3x to all-in
- bad hands: K7o, A5o
- if you represent top pair and show in turn, don't bluff
- if you call 3-bet OOP and hit nuts, check raise
- don't bluff fish-calling station
